        Your day lesson begins with an equipment introduction and demonstration.
        You begin ground handling, also known as 'kiting' with the aid of your
        instructor. We practice inflating and controlling the wing on the
        ground, learning the launch sequence, discussing the landing, and
        steering skills before introducing the element of flight.

        You have made the decision to become a certified paraglider pilot. This
        program is an intensive course designed to produce a safe, confident and
        competent pilot. During this program you will learn about glider
        aerodynamics, meteorology, thermal flying, ridge soaring, flight
        maneuvers and emergency procedures. We focus on building your launching,
        landing and flight techniques through intensive ground handling
        (kiting), low altitude solo flights, flight simulations and ground
        schooling. You will complete the USHPA-mandated amount of ground-school
        time, flights, and flying days. The course length is variable; the
        average student should expect to spend 7-12 days of training with us.
        After the completion of the course you will have acquired the skills and
        knowledge to fly without direct instructor supervision at certain sites.
        This is the start of your Paragliding career. You will have the greatest
        success learning to paraglide if you can immerse yourself in the course
        and then continue flying or kiting regularly after completing your
        lessons. Private lessons are also available and our fees are structured
        on an individual basis.

        For those who want to find out what paragliding is all about but not
        wanting to commit to lessons, we offer instructional tandem flights. The
        tandem flight consists of a short briefing followed by a pre-determined
        flight time. If good soaring conditions are not available, the flight
        will be re-scheduled. During the flight the pilot will explain what he
        is doing, and allow you some hands-on control of the glider. A tandem
        flight is best for the person seeking an exciting one-time experience,
        with minimum commitment.
