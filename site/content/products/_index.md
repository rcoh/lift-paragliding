        Find out what paragliding is all about without committing to lessons
        wanting to commit to lessons, we offer instructional tandem flights. The
        tandem flight consists of a short briefing followed by a pre-determined
        flight time. If good soaring conditions are not available, the flight
        will be re-scheduled. During the flight the pilot will explain what he
        is doing, and allow you some hands-on control of the glider. A tandem
        flight is best for the person seeking an exciting one-time experience,
        with minimum commitment.
        items:
        - Short briefing
        - Predetermined flight time (rescheduled if soaring conditions are not available)
        - Hands-on control of the glider!
